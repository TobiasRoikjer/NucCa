# Nucleosome ctDNA analysis code
Usage: extract this to a (linux) server. Build the cproj files in tools/cproj using cmake.

## Contents
 - pipeline/arr-paired-reads: Create fragments from paired DNA reads
 - pipeline/make-nuc-file: Create a nucleosome reference file from a nucleosome
BED file.
 - pipeline/assign-by-midpoint: Assign fragments to a nucleosome by nearest
midpoint to midpoint in a nucleosome reference
 - pipeline/assign-by-edge: Assign fragments to a nucleosome by nearest edge to
midpoint in a nucleosome reference. Works independently of fragment edges

## Example

Pipeline:
 - First create nucleosome references in the directory pipeline/make-nuc-file (read README.md in there)
 - Then create fragments from BAM files in the directory pipeline/arr-paired-reads (read README.md in there)
 - Then run one of the other pipielines (read README.md in their directories)

Example: create nucleosome reference nuc_fil.tsv. Create fragments in dir frags. Run assign-by-edge, list_all.py frags nuc_fil.tsv out
